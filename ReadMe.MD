This is some practice I have done using the weather APi and following along a youtube tutorial on how to use Apis for weather app. Very good for trying to learn HTML,CSS,Javascript and basic intro to Apis. By default it is set to Denver, if you hit enter or search button it should go to Hargeisa Somalia.
